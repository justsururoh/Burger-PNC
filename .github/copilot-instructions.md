<!-- Copied/merged guidance for AI coding agents working on this repository -->
# Copilot instructions for this repo

This is a small static website (HTML/CSS/JS) for a burger shop. The guidance below highlights concrete patterns, conventions, and edit points so an AI agent can be productive immediately.

Core overview
- Single-purpose static site served from repository root: multiple HTML pages (e.g. `index.html`, `shop.html`, `cart.html`, `menu.html`) plus `main.css` and `script.js`.
- No build system, package manager, or tests. Serve with a static HTTP server for accurate behavior (see "Dev / test commands").

Key implementation patterns
- Central product model: `script.js` contains an in-memory `products` array. Add/remove/modify products by editing that array and placing corresponding images under `image/`.
- Cart persistence: cart state is stored in `localStorage` under the key `cart`. Functions to update cart: `addToCart()`, `removeFromCart()`, `updateQuantity()` and `checkout()` in `script.js`.
- DOM initialization: pages check for page-specific element IDs on DOMContentLoaded (`shop-products`, `cart-items`, `menu-burgers`, `contact-form`) and call loaders (`loadShopProducts()`, `loadCartItems()`, `loadMenuItems()`). Edits should preserve those IDs or adjust initialization logic.
- UI wiring: many interactive elements are generated by JS and use inline `onclick` handlers (e.g. `onclick="addToCart(1)"`). When refactoring, maintain these handlers or update all generated templates consistently.

Files to inspect for common tasks (examples)
- Add a new menu product: edit `script.js` -> `products` array and add the image to `image/`.
- Modify shop layout: edit `shop.html` and `main.css` (global styles are in `main.css`). Note: `.container` uses a fixed width (1331px) which affects responsive changes.
- Fix cart behavior: `cart` is loaded from `localStorage` at top of `script.js`. To migrate storage keys, update both `localStorage.getItem` and `localStorage.setItem` usages.

Dev / test commands
- Quick local server (recommended):
  - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` (run from repository root)
  - Node: `npx http-server . -p 8000`
- In VS Code: use the Live Server extension to serve pages and view `localStorage` behavior (required for the cart).

Project-specific gotchas & conventions
- No backend: all checkout flows are demo-only (see `checkout()` in `script.js` which only shows an alert and clears the cart). Do not add server-side assumptions unless adding an API and documenting it.
- CDN assets: fonts and icons are loaded from CDNs. Note a malformed Boxicons link in `index.html` (mismatched quotes) — fix before relying on boxicons.
- Layout: `main.css` contains long, monolithic styles. Keep CSS edits minimal and localize changes where possible.
- Accessibility: interactive controls are often buttons inside anchors or use inline event handlers. Prefer semantic elements and ARIA when adding new features.

Behavioral guidance for code changes
- Preserve or intentionally update DOM IDs that `script.js` expects (listed above). If you rename an ID, update both the HTML and the loader check in `script.js`.
- When adding products, ensure `id` is unique and numeric (other code expects numeric IDs). Keep `price` as a number.
- Avoid heavy refactors that split responsibilities across files without tests — this repo relies on clear, immediate changes to `script.js`/HTML/CSS.

If you change behavior that affects persistence or page initialization, include manual test steps in the PR description (serve site, add item to cart, refresh, verify cart count and localStorage).

Contact / follow-ups
- If you need a build, tests, or a backend added, propose a minimal design (e.g., small Express API for orders + JSON file or SQLite) and include migration steps for `localStorage` data.
